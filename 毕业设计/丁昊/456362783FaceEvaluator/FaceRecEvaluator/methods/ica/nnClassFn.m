%
%Reads in training examples, test examples, class labels of training
%examples, and correct class of test examples. Data are in columns of train
%and test, and labels are column vectors.
% 
%Note: You will need to create label vectors. TrainClass is a column 
%vector of integers indicating the identity of the training examples. 
%e.g. for faces of 3 people with two views each, TrainClass = [1 1 2 2 3 3 ]';
%Answer contains the correct labels of the test images, which enables
%us to compute percent correct.  
%
%Gets matrix of normalized dot products. Outputs nearest neighbor
%classification of test examples and percent correct.
%rankmat gives the top 30 matches for each test image.  rank is a vector
%containing the percent of times the correct match is in the top N matches.
