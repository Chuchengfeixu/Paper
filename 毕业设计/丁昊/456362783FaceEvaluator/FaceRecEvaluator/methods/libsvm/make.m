% Face Recognition Evaluator -> make.m: Makes libsvm MEX interface for
% Matlab. The original libsvm MEX suffers from large memory overhead,
% passing the model back and forth between C and Matlab. This is a slightly
% modified version that offers more options to reduce the overhead of
% passing data back and forth. It also reduces replicated data.
