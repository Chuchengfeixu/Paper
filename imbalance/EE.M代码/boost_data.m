function [boostset, boosttarget] = boost_data(trainset, traintarget,weight)
% To sample a subset according to each example's weight
% Input:
%   trainset: n-by-d training set
%   traintarget: n-by-1 training target
%   weight: n-by-1 weight vector, with its sum is 1
% Output:
%   boostset: sampled data set
%   boosttarget: labels for boostset
